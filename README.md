Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project revolved around employing an embedded device to monitor room temperature and control an LED that illuminated when the temperature fell below the designated setpoint. Additionally, two buttons enabled setpoint adjustments. Temperature data was transmitted through UART in the sequence: current temperature, setpoint temperature, and timer duration.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well in debugging challenges and addressing warnings in the project. Initially encountering multiple issues, I  utilized online resources, particularly Google, to search for error solutions by examining similar problems and their corresponding resolutions. This approach enabled me to troubleshoot effectively and enhance my problem-solving skills.

Where could you improve?

I think I could have enhanced my code by minimizing the utilization of global variables. Additionally, I could have placed a greater emphasis on optimization techniques to ensure efficient memory usage, particularly concerning memory allocation.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Learning to work with microcontrollers defintly will help me in projects that require hardware. Before undertaking this course, I lacked any  knowledge of how to begin utilizing a microcontroller to read data. However, after gaining insights into the TI architectures, I have more confidence in myself and plan to work on a personal project with the use of the TI board.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I ensured project maintainability, readability, and adaptability through modular coding practices, clear documentation, and adherence to coding standards. Each function had a specific purpose, enhancing code reusability and making future modifications easier. Descriptive comments explained complex logic and peripherals. Consistent variable naming and indentation improved readability.
